**HOW TO USE THE AUTOTAGGER**

* The Autotagger is a tool that allows for the TXT file (data to be converted)
into an XML file.

On the Autotagger Page:

1. UPLOAD the TXT file ("Svoboda Diaries Transcription Format")
2. SELECT Upload Transcription
  **IF THERE ARE ERRORS**, fix them in the TXT file (specific line numbers will be shown)
  and repeat steps 1-2
3. SAVE the XML file to your local Machine
   * naming convention (same as txt file but with different extension): Diary##_ YYYYMMDD


**COMMON ERRORS**
- Not distinguishing between body and head of text (check structure - ex. Notes:, then margin lines)
- Spacing before and after Section and Subsections
- Make sure page numbers are consistent!

* Other notes:
1. Each week, update aggregated transcription file with new transcriptions, check format, etc.
2. Get XML file
3. Email TXT and XML files to Tech Support
